K14: Form and Function/made a form and printed a greeting using the form responses
2021-10-14

-only creates a form in "/" because that's the only time you call render_template
-once you submit it takes you to "/auth"
-the username variable is the user's input in the initial page
-we wanted to use the variable username to return a greeting included with that username
-ended up needing to use request.args['username'] in app.py
-we weren't sure what was meant by "include request method used," but after talking to classmates
from both periods we came to a consensus that we should just return the request that was also
printed in the terminal in the template app.py
-the request printed on the response page has the link we used to access it and
the user input with [GET] at the end of it, which is a method that could be used
to retrieve user input data
