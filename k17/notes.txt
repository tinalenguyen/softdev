2021-10-25
Time Spent: 15 min

Text Box
- used c.executemany, no for loop, creates an array that gets directly inserted

Team Snaps
- newline can cause problems within systems
- separating each value and then creating one concatenated string

CircleTable
- removing tables if they already exist (DROP TABLE)
- made a read_data function
- also used executemany

Team02
- tuple=list that you aren't allowed to change
- do not insert if it is already in the table (accounts for duplicates)

Team Toast
- also used DROP TABLE but with try except

Forgotten Charger
- also used DROP TABLE
- f string=you can use brackets to put in the parts you need, no need to concatenate (f stands for format)

The Onions
- created helper functions printDB and dict2SQ
