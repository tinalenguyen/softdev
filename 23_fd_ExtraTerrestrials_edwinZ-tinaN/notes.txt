K23 - No. 2? -- Making a Website in Foundation
2021-12-01
time spent: TBD

DISCO
  We talked about the differences between Foundation and Bootstrap, and we agreed
  that the formatting for both are very different. Otherwise, the two are very
  similar in code and feature-wise.

  Secure Bathtubs showed us some key features of Foundation like buttons, search
  bars, and navigation bars. These features can also be implemented in Bootstrap.
QCC
  We asked if Foundation had any color changing options-there were ways to do so,
  but it would be difficult to change the color of something.
