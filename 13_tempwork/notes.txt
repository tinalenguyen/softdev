K13 -- Occupation Flask App Template

"""

In order to access files such as the occupations.csv or occupations.py we had to
use "./data/occupations.csv" to indicate the location of the files.

In the app file, we simply ran the functions from the occupations.py file.

It creates a dictionary containing occupations as keys and a tuple containing
percentages and links as values.

A tuple had to be used since each key was associated with multiple values, and
we bundled them together into a tuple.

We made sure that the route was /occupyflaskst.

Once we got the dictionary of jobs and randomly chosen occupation, we were able
to input this data into the 'tablified.html' template using render_template.

Using a for loop, we created a table with rows displaying occupations,
percentages, and clickable links that corresponded to what random occupation was
chosen.


EGO:

The main point is to be receptive about advice/correction and not get defensive
if you make an error or are confused about something.
