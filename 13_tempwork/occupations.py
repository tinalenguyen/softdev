# Our approach.
# The program has two parts: reading the CSV file and picking a random
# occupation, weighted by the specified percentages. The first part involves
# csv module, which allows us to not worry about edge cases like when commas
# are within a cell. Ignoring the first header line, we convert all of the rows
# to dictionary entries, converting the percentage to a float in the process.
# The last important note is that we replace "Total" with "Other" and assign
# it a percentage equal to 100 minus the total percentage, assuming that jobs
# not listed in the occupations list take up the remaining percentage points.
# Lastly, we can use random.choices(), which is a weighted selection method
# that works quite easily with the dictionary entries we have. We then return
# the selected job class.

# How to use.
# This script works in two ways. You can either run it as a script on its own,
# in which case it will read from occupations.csv in the same directory and
# print the selected job class, or you can use the method separately, calling
# occupations.random_occupation(filename) and passing in the path to the CSV
# file as the filename, in which case it will return a string containing the
# selected job class.
