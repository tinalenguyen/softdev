Questions:
* How should the remaining 0.2% not assigned to a job class be handled?
* What is a defaultdict?

Comments:
* Different groups interpreted the remaining 0.2% (the occupations list did not
    add up to 100%) in different ways, opting for nothing, "Other",
    "Unemployed", etc.
* Many groups split the two tasks (file reading and weighted random selection)
    into two methods.
* Many groups did not follow Python capitalization conventions, using camelCase
    to name variables and methods instead of the conventional snake_case.

Concerns:
* Using init() as a method name is likely to be confused with __init__().
* Using .keys() and .values() would only work after Python 3.7 because in prior
    versions the order of the keys and values would not necessarily correspond
    with each other. In previous versions, we would have had to use .items()
    and split the returned tuples.
