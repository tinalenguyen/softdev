python3 -m venv ~/myherozero

This command creates a new virtual environment at the given directory, in this
case ~/myherozero, and creates the directory if it doesn't exist. It executes
the contents of the venv module (as indicated by the -m flag).

The venv module is a built-in module to create virtual environments, which
are isolated runtimes that allow Python users to keep and update packages
within a single project. Within a virtual environment, programs will have
access to only the modules installed in the virtual environment directory,
allowing programmers to manage and update package versions.

A package contains modules which are Python files, and they have potentially
useful methods in them. Those methods could save you from writing thousands
of lines of code. You would get these packages from https://pypi.org.

Why do we use virtual environments? It's super helpful to be able to keep all
of the dependencies (the packages a project uses) in one place, where we can
manage and update them without worrying about how other projects or the rest of
the Python installation affects it.
