- we added a section for the user to type a password in
- if you make the type of input "password," the text in the box would display as stars and stay hidden
- we made a unique login combo, and if the username and password doesn't match that combo an error will pop up
- there's an error for when nothing is inputted in either the username or password box
- we made the error text red in login.html
- the logout button is a button that redirects the user to the original login page
