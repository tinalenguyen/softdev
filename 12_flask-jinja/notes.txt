Q0: If you remove render_template from this line, the file would not run
because you need to import render_template for line 23 to work.

Q1: The URL to load that page would be localhost:5000/my_foist_template.

Q2: The template uses the keyword arguments in the render_template method to
replace the bracketed fields in the template.

Our Observations:
We noticed that there was the syntax for loading arguments uses curly braces. 
The code also uses {% endfor %} to end the loop which prints out the list of
numbers. Double curly braces would be used for variables that could be changed
by the user. A single curly brace with a percentage sign indicates Python code.
We can use a template for the user to easily replace variables and the
variables can be changed within a file.
