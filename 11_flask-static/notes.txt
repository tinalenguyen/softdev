When we try to go to localhost:5000/static/foo (the plaintext file), it tries
to download the file contents as a text file.

For Safari and Firefox, a prompt asking if we want to download the file appears,
while for Google Chrome it automatically downloads.

When we go to localhost:5000/static/foo.html (the HTML file), it displays the
file contents as an HTML webpage.

If we make a Python file and add it to the static directory, it also tries to
download the file contents, but as a Python file instead.

It looks like the way files are handled/displayed is dependent on the file
extension (.html, no extension, .py, etc.)
