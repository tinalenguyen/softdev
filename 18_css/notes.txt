K18 - Comic Sans Syndrome / CSS Basics
time spent: 1 hour

- we used cat ipsum text

- for the inline type HTML file, there were a lot of lines with style text
- for the external type HTML file, we imported an external file with CSS in it
  - in the CSS file, there were lines formatting columns
  - this file was called "style.css"
- for the internal type HTML file, there was a paragraph for each column
  - elements seemed to be divided by columns
    - column 1 was just the side elements
    - column 2 was the text (cat ipsum text)
